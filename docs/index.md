# Decoders

Decoders are installed between Google-managed inbound data transfers into BigQuery, and subsequent transformation activities. 


## What?
Decoders:
- Restructure inbound data to optimise for query and analysis
- Optionally augment data from external sources
- Efficiently and reponsively curate downstream data tables


- Utility
- Pre-modelled data, optimised for modelling, query and analysis.
- Configurable
- Zero maintenance
- Cost optimised
- Optimised for connection to BI tools

## Why?
- Inbound data not optimised for modelling, query or analytics
- Optimised for 
    - schema stability w/ extensibility
    - storage
    - table singularity
- if you find yourself doing anything difficult and annoying over and over again 

## How?
- native BigQuery/GCP tools
- SQL-based data profiling
- nested-content-derived schema generation
- efficient automation 
- extensibility

- built on the foundations of the bqtools functional library for BigQuery
